# Interpreting-a-Data-Visualization-Dashboard
This is a brief and first project carried out as a prerequisite to my graduation from Udacity Nanodegree course.
### Description 

In this project, [African malaria dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/MakeoverMonday34Malaria_0/MalariainAfrica?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:display_count=y&:display_static_image=y&:bootstrapWhenNotified=true) on Tableau was briefly visualized and interpreted.
Three insights were drawn from the data which were concisely interpreted using screenshots from the data.

### Insights
* From the data, I deduced that from 2001 to 2014, average malaria deaths recorded in Zambia made up about 4.5% total average malaria deaths recorded in Africa. The highest malaria deaths in the country was recorded in 2001 (about 57% above average). Malaria deaths in the country had since then reduced save for slight increases observed in years 2009 and 2010.
* About 5.5k malaria deaths were recorded per year in Nigeria with an upshot (about 10289 malaria deaths) observed in year 2007; year with the highest malaria death in the country. Since then, malaria deaths had only increased steadily above average.
* Malaria deaths in Angola seemed to be below average, except for the unusual trend that occurred between 2002 to 2005. These were the only years the country recorded malaria deaths above average. An excessive rise was seen in year 2003; 38598 total malaria deaths which made up about 38% total malaria deaths observed in Africa that year.

### Conclusion
Deaths caused by malaria in Africa seemed so great an issue in those years. Appreciations to those constantly fighting and preventing it.
